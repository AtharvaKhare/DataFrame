DataFrame is a tabular data structure for data analysis, similar to [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) in Python or [data.frame](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.2/topics/data.frame) in R. It is a spreadsheet-like data structure with an API specifically designed for data exploration and analysis.

DataFrame library consists of two primary data structures:
* `DataFrame` is a spreadsheet-like tabular data structure that works like a relational database by providing the API for querying the data. Each row represents an observation, and every column is a feature. Both rows and columns of a data frame have names (keys) by which they can be accessed.
* `DataSeries` is an array-like data structure used for working with specific rows or columns of a data frame. It has a name and contains an array of data mapped to a corresponding array of keys. DataSeries is a SequenceableCollection that combines the properties of an Array and a Dictionary, while extending the functionality of both by providing advanced messages for working with data, such as statistical summaries, visualizations etc.
