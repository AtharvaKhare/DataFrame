# DataFrame Roadmap

In this document, I describe the functionality that we want to add to DataFrame in the nearest future. For the specific features that need to be added, please check the [issues](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/DataFrame/issues).

* Handling missing values
* Time series

We should find time to go over the documentation of pandas and R and create the complete list of everything we don't have.
